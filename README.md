# **GOOGLE MAP MANIPULATION.**
## I wrote a project using Various google Apis to track user location, show general shops around the user, and show directions from user location to marker points. 

*This project is an Android app which displays data from:
[Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/)
[Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/android-api/)
[Google Directions API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/intro)*

**Notes**: 
Libraries used to parse data: HttpURLConnection (Java's)

To test app. open it, drag the map marker at your location to a point, and press the "To" button.
